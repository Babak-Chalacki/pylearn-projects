# JavaScript vs Python vs PHP Project Comparison

This repository showcases four projects implemented in JavaScript, Python, and PHP to compare the three languages:

## Projects

1. **Calculator**: A basic arithmetic calculator.
2. **Average Grades**: Calculates the average of student grades.
3. **Degrees/Radians Converter**: Converts degrees to radians and vice versa.
4. **BMI Calculator**: Calculates Body Mass Index.
4. **triangle**: Calculates sides.

## Structure

```
/javascript/
    calculator.js
    average_grades.js
    degrees_radians.js
    bmi_calculator.js
    triangle.js
/python/
    calculator.py
    average_grades.py
    degrees_radians.py
    bmi_calculator.py
    triangle.py
/php/
    calculator.php
    average_grades.php
    degrees_radians.php
    bmi_calculator.php
    triangle.php
```

## How to Run

- **JavaScript**: Use Node.js or a web browser.
- **Python**: Run with Python 3.
- **PHP**: Run with PHP CLI or a web server.

**project 2**



This project contains several Python projects that demonstrate various programming concepts and functionalities. Below is a brief description of each project along with instructions on how to use them.

## 1. Guess the Number Game

A game where the user guesses a randomly generated number. After winning, the program displays the number of attempts made.

### Usage
- Run the program.
- Follow the prompts to guess the number.
- View the total number of guesses after winning.

---

## 2. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A complete implementation of the classic game where the user plays against the computer.

### Usage
- Run the program.
- Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The program displays the result of each round.

---

## 3. Student Grades Average Calculator

This program allows the user to input student grades until "exit" is entered, then calculates the average grade.

### Usage
- Run the program.
- Enter grades one by one.
- Type "exit" to finish and see the average.

---

## 4. Time to Seconds Converter

Converts a given time in hours, minutes, and seconds into total seconds.

### Example
- Input: `01:00:20`
- Output: `3620 seconds`

### Usage
- Run the program.
- Enter the time in `HH:MM:SS` format.

---

## 5. Seconds to Time Converter

Converts a given number of seconds into a formatted time string (HH:MM:SS).

### Example
- Input: `3620 seconds`
- Output: `01:00:20`

### Usage
- Run the program.
- Enter the number of seconds.

---

## 6. Dice Simulation Game

Simulates rolling a dice. The user continues to roll until a 6 is rolled, allowing for bonus rolls.

### Usage
- Run the program.
- Roll the dice and see the result.
- Roll again if a 6 is rolled.

---

## 7. Fibonacci Sequence Generator

Generates the first `n` elements of the Fibonacci sequence based on user input.

### Example
- Input: `n = 7`
- Output: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8`

### Usage
- Run the program.
- Enter the number of Fibonacci elements to generate.
