---

## 5. Seconds to Time Converter

Converts a given number of seconds into a formatted time string (HH:MM:SS).

### Example
- Input: `3620 seconds`
- Output: `01:00:20`

### Usage
- **Python**: Run the file `seconds_to_time.py`.
- **PHP**: Run the file `seconds_to_time.php`.
- Enter the number of seconds.

---

## 6. Dice Simulation Game

Simulates rolling a dice. The user continues to roll until a 6 is rolled, allowing for bonus rolls.

### Usage
- **Python**: Run the file `dice_game.py`.
- **PHP**: Run the file `dice_game.php`.
- Roll the dice and see the result.
- Roll again if a 6 is rolled.

---

## 7. Fibonacci Sequence Generator

Generates the first `n` elements of the Fibonacci sequence based on user input.

### Example
- Input: `n = 7`
- Output: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8`

### Usage

**project 3**

## Hangman Game

Complete the Hangman game by:
- Implementing the winning condition.
- Allowing uppercase letters (e.g., "B" should match "b").

## Unique Random Numbers Array

Create an array of length `n` filled with unique random numbers.

**Example Output:**  

[2, 3, 6, 1, 0, 14, 16, 7]


## Check Sorted Array

Write a program to check if a user-provided array is sorted in ascending order.

**Example:**  
- Input: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 7]` (Sorted)  
- Input: `[8, 5, 4, 1, 6, 7]` (Not Sorted)

## Striped Snake Pattern

Draw a striped snake of length `n` based on user input.

**Example:**  
- Input: `n = 9`  
- Output: `*#*#*#*#*`

## GCD Calculation

Write a program that receives two numbers from the user and calculates their GCD using a `for` loop.

## LCM Calculation

Write a program that receives two numbers from the user and calculates their LCM using a `for` loop.

## Word Count in Sentence

Write a program that receives a sentence from the user and counts the number of words in the sentence.

**Example:**  
- Input: `python is a powerful programming language`  
- Output: `6`

## QR Code Generator

This program takes a user's name and phone number as input and generates a QR code containing that information.

### Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Enter your phone number when prompted.
4. The program will generate a QR code file named `qrcode.png` containing your name and phone number.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `qrcode` library (install using `pip install qrcode`)

### Example

Enter your name: John Doe
Enter your phone number: 1234567890
